        </h4>
        <p>
          Using what we have derived, let us now try and understand the birth, life and death of a star.
        </p>

       <h1>
        Birth 
    </h1>
       <p>
        The birth of a star requires it to be formed from cloud of molecular gas. The reason for stars to form there 
        is that only those clouds are large enough and cold enough to undergo gravitational collapse. 
       </p>
       <p>
        We go back to fuids to find the jeans length. 
        \[1/k_j = \sqrt{\frac{v_s^2}{4\pi G \rho_0}} \]
        We can then find the mass for gravitational collpase.
        \[M_j = \frac{4\pi}{3}k_j^3 \rho_0\]
        \[M_j = \frac{4\pi}{3}(\sqrt{\frac{{v_s^2}}{ 4\pi G \rho_0}})^3 \rho_0\]
        \[M_j = \frac{4\pi}{3}(\frac{v_s^2}{4\pi G})^3 \rho_0^{-1/2}\]
        We know that the speed of sound is related to the temperature by 
        \[v_s^2 = \frac{ kT}{\mu m_p}\]
        We can then find the mass for gravitational collapse.
        \[M_j = \frac{4\pi}{3}(\sqrt{\frac{ kT}{\mu m_p}})^3 \rho_0^{-1/2}\]
        \[\boxed{M_j = \frac{4\pi}{3}(\sqrt{\frac{ k}{\mu m_p}})^3 T^{3/2}\rho_0^{-1/2}}\]
        \[\boxed{M_j \propto T^{3/2}\rho_0^{-1/2}}\]
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Cloud Collapse:</b> Isothermal collapse as molecular lines cool it down. Collapse on free fall time scales.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fragmentation: </b> clouds collapse but collapses in slightly unevenly and triggers fragmentation as 
                different areas trigger jeans instability at different times.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Proto-core:</b> As the density goes up, it becomes optically thick and suddenly is in hydrostatic equilibrum on very short 
                timescales. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Accreation Phase:</b> the cloud starts to accrete onto the proto-core. This adds additional mass and heat as the gravitational potential is converted into a luminosity.
                Energy Source: The protostar is not yet powered by nuclear fusion.
                 Its luminosity comes from the gravitational potential energy released as gas falls onto the core.
                  The luminosity is given by: \(L \approx L_{acc} \sim \frac{1}{2} \frac{G M \dot{M}}{R}\) evolving on Kelvin-Helmholtz time scales.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Molecular Disassociation and Ionization: </b>As the cloud contracts, it heats up. However, when the gas reaches specific critical temperatures, the thermal energy is no longer used to increase temperature (pressure support). Instead, it is consumed to change the state of the matter (breaking bonds or stripping electrons). 
                This is dynamically unstable and triggers collapse. It collapses on free fall time scales while dissociation and ionization releases heat which adds pressure support.
                However the process of heating up it collapses at thermal timescale and then the cycle repeats.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Pre-main sequence phase: </b> Because the outer layers are so opaque (resistant to radiation), 
                radiation cannot easily transport the energy out and thus the stars are almost entirely convective. 
                This state forces the protostar to reside on the Hayashi Line in the HR diagram—a nearly vertical line representing the region where fully convective stars in hydrostatic equilibrium must exist
                Any star to the right of this line (cooler) cannot be in hydrostatic equilibrium, which is why it is a "forbidden region".
            </li>
        </ol>
       </p>
     <h1>
        Life - Main Sequence
     </h1>
     <p>
        The life of a star stays on the main sequence and burns hydrogen in its core. The Main Sequence (MS) is defined by a state of Complete Equilibrium. A star on the MS satisfies two conditions simultaneously:
        Hydrostatic Equilibrium and Thermal Equilibrium (This means there is no net change in the star's entropy with time).
     </p>
     <p>
        To understand the life of a MS star requires us to solve the stellar structure equations. But we can also get out useful scalings 
        using Homology.
     </p>
     <p>
        Here are the stellar structure equations:
        \[\frac{dM}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho \tag{mass conservation}\]
        \[\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{GM}{r^2} \rho \tag{hydrostatic equilibrium}\]
        We can have radiative diffusion or convection as the dominant energy transport.
        \[\frac{dT}{dr} = -4 \pi r^2 \rho [\frac{-Gm}{4\pi r^2} \frac{T}{P} \nabla_{rad}],\quad \nabla_{rad}= \frac{3\kappa }{16 \pi a c G} \frac{lm}{mT^4} \tag{radiative diffusion}\]
        \[\frac{dT}{dr} = -4 \pi r^2 \rho [\frac{-Gm}{4\pi r^2} \frac{T}{P} \nabla_{ad}],\quad \nabla_{ad} \Rightarrow \frac{r}{T} \frac{dT}{dr}_{ad} = \frac{1}{\gamma}\frac{\rho}{P} \frac{dP}{dr} \tag{convection diffusion}\]
        \[\frac{dL}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho \epsilon \tag{energy production}\]
        We can then use homology to get the following scalings:
     </p>
     <h4>
        Homology
     </h4>
     <p>
        Homology essentially, homology treats different stars as scaled versions of each other. They assume in HE, same opacity, same EOS and 
        such. Example <b>mass conservation</b>:
        \[\frac{dM_1}{dr_1} = 4\pi r_1^2 \rho_1 \]
        \[dM_1 = dM_2 \frac{M_1}{M_2} \]
        \[dr_1 = dr_2 \frac{r_1}{r_2} \]
        We can then write the mass conservation equation as:
        \[\frac{dM_1}{dr_1} = \frac{dM_2}{dr_2} \frac{M_1}{M_2} \frac{r_2}{r_1} \]
        add in the mass continuity equation 
        \[4\pi r_1^2 \rho_1  =  4\pi r_2^2 \rho_2  \frac{M_1}{M_2} \frac{r_2}{r_1} \]
        \[r_1^3 \rho_1  =  \rho_2  \frac{M_1}{M_2} r_2^3 \]
        \[\boxed{ \frac{\rho_1}{ \rho_2}   =    \frac{M_1}{M_2}(\frac{r_1}{r_2})^{-3}} \]

 
     </p>
     <p>
        <b>Hydrostatic equilibrium</b>:
        \[\frac{dP_1}{dr_1} = -\frac{G M_1}{r_1^2} \rho_1 \]
        \[dP_1 = dP_2 \frac{P_1}{P_2} \]
        \[dr_1 = dr_2 \frac{r_1}{r_2} \]
        We can then write the hydrostatic equilibrium equation as:
        \[\frac{dP_1}{dr_1} = \frac{dP_2}{dr_2} \frac{P_1}{P_2} \frac{r_2}{r_1} \]
        add in the hydrostatic equilibrium equation 
        \[-\frac{G M_1}{r_1^2} \rho_1  =  -\frac{G M_2}{r_2^2} \rho_2  \frac{P_1}{P_2} \frac{r_2}{r_1} \]
        Simplify
        \[-\frac{M_1}{r_1} \rho_1  =  -\frac{ M_2}{r_2} \rho_2  \frac{P_1}{P_2} \]
        \[\frac{ M_1}{M_2} \frac{r_2}{r_1} \frac{\rho_1}{\rho_2}  = \frac{P_1}{P_2} \]
        We can replace density with our previous homology result 
        \[\frac{ M_1}{M_2} \frac{r_2}{r_1} \frac{M_1}{M_2}\frac{r_2^3}{r_1^3}  = \frac{P_1}{P_2} \]
        \[\boxed{ \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{ M_1^2}{M_2^2} \frac{r_2^4}{r_1^4}  }\]
        If we used the equation of state \(P= nkT\) we can get 
        \[\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\rho_1}{\rho_2} \frac{T_1}{T_2}\]
        \[\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{M_1 /R_1^3}{M_2 /R_2^3} \frac{T_1}{T_2}\]

        We can then replace to get 
        \[\boxed{ \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{ M_1}{M_2} \frac{r_2}{r_1}  }\]


     </p>
     <p>
        <b>Radiative:</b> let us look at how to get out luminosity: 
        \[\frac{dT_1}{dr_1} = \frac{-3 \kappa \rho_1}{4 ac} \frac{1}{T_1^3} \frac{l}{4\pi r_1^2}\]
        Let us slowly replace everything with our homology results:
        \[ \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{ M_1}{M_2} \frac{r_2}{r_1} \]
        \[\frac{dT_1}{dr_1} = \frac{-3 \kappa \rho_1}{4 ac} \frac{1}{(T_2 \frac{ M_1}{M_2} \frac{r_2}{r_1})^3 } \frac{l}{4\pi r_1^2}\]
        
        more homology results
        \[\frac{\rho_1}{ \rho_2}   =    \frac{M_1}{M_2}(\frac{r_1}{r_2})^{-3}\]
        place it in 
        \[\frac{dT_1}{dr_1} = \frac{-3 \kappa \rho_2 \frac{M_1}{M_2}(\frac{r_1}{r_2})^{-3}}{4 ac} \frac{1}{(T_2 \frac{ M_1}{M_2} \frac{r_2}{r_1})^3 } \frac{l}{4\pi (r_2 \frac{R_1}{R_2})^2}\]
        \[\frac{dT_1}{dr_1} = \frac{-3 \kappa \rho_2 }{4 ac} \frac{1}{ ( \frac{ M_1}{M_2})^{2}T_2  } \frac{\frac{l_1}{l_2}}{4\pi (r_2 \frac{R_1}{R_2})^2}\]
        \[\frac{dT_1}{dr_1} = (\frac{ M_1}{M_2})^{-2} (\frac{ r_1}{r_2})^{-2}\]

        We replace the derivative: 
        \[\frac{dT_1}{dr_1}  = \frac{dT_2}{dr_1} \frac{T_2 (\mu1/\mu2) (M_1/M_2)(R_2/R_1)}{r_2 R_1/R_2}  = \mu (M_1/M_2) (R_2/R_1)^2\]
        Now we figure out the right side:
        \[\boxed{\frac{l_1}{l_2} \propto (\frac{m_1}{m_2})^{3} \mu_1^{4} \mu_2^{4}}\]
        If you add back krammers opacity you get 
        \[\]

    <p>The key event in a star's late life is whether its core crosses the <strong>boundary of electron degeneracy</strong> in the temperature-density plane <span class="citation"></span>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>If it crosses:</strong> The core becomes supported by electron degeneracy pressure. This pressure is independent of temperature, so it stops the contraction and prevents the core from heating up further to ignite the next fuel (e.g., Carbon).

        <li><strong>If it never crosses:</strong> The core continues to contract and heat up, igniting successively heavier elements (C, Ne, O, Si) until it forms an Iron core and collapses/explodes <span class="citation"></span>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Low and Intermediate Mass Stars (M &lt; 8 M<sub>&#9737;</sub>)</h2>

     <h4>
        White Dwarf
     </h4>
     <p>
        White dwarfs are the final stage of stellar evolution for stars with masses less than 8 \(M_\odot\). And they are unique 
        in that they are supported by electron degeneracy pressure rather than thermal pressure.
     </p>
     <p>
        Let us find how the radius and mass scale with each other.
         We start with the hydrostatic equilibrium equation:
        \[\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{Gm}{r} \rho\]
        \[\frac{P}{r} \sim -\frac{Gm}{r} \rho\]
        \[P \sim -\frac{Gm^2}{r^4}\]
        \[P \sim K \rho^{5/3} \tag{EOS degenerate NR}\]
        plug in for density
        \[P \sim K M^{5/3} \frac{1}{R^5} \]
        \[ -\frac{GM^2}{r^4} \propto K M^{5/3} \frac{1}{R^5}\]
        \[ -\frac{G}{r^4} \propto K M^{-1/3} \frac{1}{R^5}\]
        \[\boxed{R \propto M^{-1/3}}\]
        <B>
            Chandrasekhar Limit:
        </B> given by when equation of state goes relativistic and is dynamically unstable.
        \[P \sim K M^{4/3} \frac{1}{R^4} \]
        \[ -\frac{GM^2}{r^4} \propto K M^{4/3} \frac{1}{R^4}\]
        We see that radius cancels out and we get just a mass relation: 
        \[\boxed{M \propto (K/G)^{3/2} \sim 1.44 M_\odot}\]

     </p>
     <p>
        <b>Temperature and Luminosity relation</b>
        The White Dwarf has a highly conductive, isothermal core (at temperature \(T_c\)) wrapped in a thin, 
        non-degenerate, radiative envelope.
         The luminosity is determined by how easily heat can leak through this opaque envelope.
         \[\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{Gm}{r^2} \rho\tag{hydrostatic equilibrium}\]
         \[\frac{dT}{dr} = \frac{-3\kappa \rho}{16 \pi ac} \frac{L}{4\pi r^2T^3} \tag{radiative diffusion}\]
         We divde the two equations to get:
         \[\frac{dT}{dP} = \frac{\kappa L}{MT^3}\]
         bring in the opacity from kramers opacity law:
         \[\kappa \propto \rho T^{-7/2}\]
         \[\frac{dT}{dP} = \frac{L}{MT^{17/2}}P\]
         We integrate 
         \[\int T^{17/2}dT = \int \frac{L}{M}PdP\]
         \[\frac{2}{19}T^{19/2} = \frac{L}{M}P^2\]
         \[\frac{2}{19}T^{19/4} (\frac{L}{M})^{-2}= P\]

        We can drop in ideal gas law 
        \[\rho \propto \frac{P}{kT}\]
        \[\rho \propto \frac{\frac{2}{19}T^{19/4} (\frac{L}{M})^{-2}}{T}\]

        At the core the equation of state needs to match 
        \[P = kT = \rho^{5/3}\]
        together we get that:
        \[\boxed{L \propto M T^{7/2}}\]


     </p>
     <p>
        <b>Cooling time:</b> since there is no energy production,
         the white dwarf will cool down via radiative diffusion.
         

     </p>
     <p>
        Total energy stored: 
        \[U = MT\]
        We also know that the temperature luminosity relation is:
        \[L\propto T^{7/2}\]
        \[L^{2/7}\propto T\]
        And we know that 
        \[L = \frac{dU}{dt}\]
        We rewrite 
        \[\]
        \[L = M\frac{dT}{dt}\]
        \[L = M\frac{dL^{2/7}}{dt}\]
        \[L = ML^{-5/7}\frac{dL}{dt}\]
        \[dt= ML^{-5/7}\frac{dL}{L}\]
        \[\int dt= \int ML^{-12/7}dL\]
        \[\boxed{t\propto  ML^{-5/7}}\]

     <h4>
        Massive Stars \(M > 8 M_\odot\)
     </h4>
     <p>
        Massive stars continue to fuse Helium into larger more massive elements. 
        At the end of its nuclear burning sequence, a massive star develops an "onion skin" structure with 
        layers of progressively heavier elements, 
        ending with an Iron (Fe) core in the center. Iron cannot fuse to release energy; instead, 
        fusion would consume energy.
     </p>
     <p>
        <b>Photodisintegration:</b> Iron is broken up into smaller nuclei.
        This process is endothermic (absorbs heat), drastically reducing the core's thermal pressure. Changes the adiabatic 
        index to 4/3 and becomes unstable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Inverse Beta Decay</b>Electron Capture: 
        Due to high densities, electrons are forced into protons to form neutrons and neutrinos. And looses degeneracy pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Free fall:</b>
        With pressure support gone, the core collapses under gravity on a dynamical timescale free fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
            The Bounce:
        </b>The collapse continues until the core density exceeds nuclear density. 
        At this point, the strong nuclear force becomes repulsive (the Equation of State goes back to 5/3), 
        causing the inner core to rebound or "bounce". 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Shock:</b>This bounce generates a big shock wave that moves outward.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Stalling:</b> As the shock moves through the outer iron core, 
        it loses energy by dissociating heavy nuclei, causing it to stall.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
            Neutrino Revival:
        </b>
        The collapsing core releases a massive burst of neutrinos. These neutrinos deposit 
        some of their energy into the stalled shock layer, reheating it and "reviving" the shock.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Key Calculations:</b>
        Energetics of the core: 
        \[\Delta E = GM_c^2/R_c \sim 10^{53} ergs\]
        Energy of the shock: 
        \[\Delta E = \frac{1}{2} M_c v_s^2 \sim 10^{51} ergs\]
        Energy of the neutrinos should be carying away the result which is \(99\%\) of the energy. The neutrinos 
        are fromed via inverse beta decay and electron capture. 


      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Neutrino Trapping:</b>
        We find the cross section for neutrino scattering and then find the mean free path to see that the core would be 
        too dense and thus traps the neutrinos in it.
